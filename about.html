        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          I am a college student with a passion for problem-solving and creating things to simplify everyday tasks, whether in the digital world or
          real-life situations. Over the past 5+ years, I have gained experience in Arduino, graphic design, 3D modeling, and web development. While
          working in the media unit of my school, I have assisted my colleagues in solving their computer-related issues and other problems.
        </p>
        <p>
          I take a long-lasting and reliable approach to delivering solutions and creating things, regardless of the effort involved. I am constantly
          seeking new challenges and opportunities to expand my skills and knowledge. Whether it's developing a new website, designing a logo, or
          creating a functional prototype, I am always excited to tackle new projects and bring ideas to life. My goal is to continue learning and
          growing in the field of technology and innovation.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am currently seeking new knowledge to improve my skills and develop a full-stack website, something I have wanted to do for a long time.

          <h3>Graphic Designing</h3>
          <p>
            I started off with CorelDraw. Slowly learned Photoshop and Illustrator. I mostly did flyer designing and still do. My experiences are
            limited in this field. But I've mostly worked in this field (quantity-wise).
          </p>
          <h3>3D Modeling</h3>
          <p>
            3D Modeling is the thing I have done the longest. What I can do best is model and texture Hard Surface models. Started off with Blender
            then I learned Autodesk Maya, then Adobe Substance Painter. I have done many personal projects.
          </p>
          <h3>Web Development</h3>
          <p>
            I recently got started with web development and I know Html and Css to a level where I can create a website by myself. But JavaScript, not
            so much. Among backend programming languages the only one I am comfortable with is PHP. Which gives me the ability to make dynamic
            websites.

          <p>
            Since I am a student I actually don't have work experience. Anything close to work experience I had is through Media Unit of my school. I
            think there was an actual working environment because, quality of our work matters. Head of technical team and whole school sees it and
            then you get good and bad criticism about the work. Since I had to work on live event quality matters more. And there are few more skills
            I have, Ableton Live, Arduino, Server Management (since I hosted websites by installing Ubuntu and setting up web-servers, reverse proxy
            and other relevant stuff). Thank you for reading this, Have A Nice Day!
